Johnny at the castle 

Johnny live in a old castle at Germany. He read lots of music books on music and he is addicted to these intersting contents.
One day, he read a book about Mozart, and felt inspired by the beatiful music. He decided to become a composer and spend the next 20 years of his life practicing his craft. He then decided he wanted to perform a symphony for the world to see. 
He spent hours practicing for his concert. He practiced his three favorite songs until he knew them by memory. He set up the date for the concert and grew more excited as the day approached.
